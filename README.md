<h1>Code Accessibility Refactoring</h1>

<div> In this project, I refactored the HTML and CSS code to meet accessibility standards via semantic tags and alt attributes for images, as well as bug fixes including hyperlinks at the top of the page. This will allow the website to better meet compliance standards and improve functionality of the page and readability of the code. </div>
